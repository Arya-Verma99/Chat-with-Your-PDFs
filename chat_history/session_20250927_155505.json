    "bot": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the Compulsory Registration order is based on the manufacturing date or the import date. I remember reading something about this in the context provided. Let me go through the context again to make sure I get the right information.\n\nLooking at the context, on Page 0 of the FINAL_FAQs_June_2018.pdf, question 1 is about the effective date of the Compulsory Registration order. The answer says that for domestically produced goods, it's based on the manufacturing date, and for imported goods, it's the date of landing in India. That makes sense because domestic products would be tracked from when they're made, and imports from when they arrive.\n\nI don't see any other information in the context that contradicts this. The other pages mention things like registration requirements, documents needed, and procedures, but nothing that changes the effective date criteria. So, the answer should be clear based on the first part of the context.\n\nI should make sure to cite the correct source, which is [FINAL_FAQs_June_2018.pdf, Page 0], as that's where the relevant information is found. I don't need to look at other pages because the answer is explicitly provided there.\n</think>\n\nThe Compulsory Registration order will be effective based on the manufacturing date for domestically produced goods and the date of landing in India for imported goods.

    "bot": "<think>\nAlright, I need to answer the question \"What can be patented?\" based on the provided context. Let me go through the context step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the sections that discuss patentability. On Page 1 of the Final_FREQUENTLY_ASKED_QUESTIONS_-PATENT.pdf, question 5 asks, \"What can be patented?\" The answer states that an invention relating to a product or process that is new, involves an inventive step, and is capable of industrial application can be patented. However, it must not fall under the non-patentable categories outlined in sections 3 and 4 of the Act.\n\nAdditionally, on Page 2 of the same document, under the criteria of patentability, it's mentioned that the invention must be novel, involve an inventive step, and be capable of industrial application. There's also a note that even if an invention meets these criteria, it might not qualify for a patent if it's frivolous, contrary to natural laws, or its primary use is prohibited.\n\nSo, putting this together, the answer should include the three main criteria: novelty, inventive step, and industrial applicability, and mention the exceptions under sections 3 and 4.\n\nI should make sure to cite the correct source, which is [Final_FREQUENTLY_ASKED_QUESTIONS_-PATENT.pdf, Page 1] for the criteria and the exceptions.\n</think>\n\nAn invention can be patented if it is a product or process that is novel, involves an inventive step, and is capable of industrial application, provided it does not fall under the non-patentable categories outlined in sections 3 and 4 of the Act.
